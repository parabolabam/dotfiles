# Nginx config file hint(auto-completion) for VS Code

[![.github/workflows/ci.yaml](https://github.com/ahmadalli/vscode-nginx-conf/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ahmadalli/vscode-nginx-conf/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)


A Visual Studio Code extension that helps you write Nginx configuration files. 
Many features in it include syntax highlight, auto-complete, in-editor documents, embedded Lua block, and more.


# Why Fork?

The [upstream repo][upstream-repo] seems to be left unmaintained and there was compatibility issue with `raynigon.nginx-formatter` extension because the upstream projects used `NGINX` as language id while the formatter extension uses `nginx` and therefore it's not possible to use both extensions on the same file

## Installation

1. Click `Extension` button in left side of VSCode. (Shortcut: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> or <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd>)
1. Search for `ahmadalli.vscode-nginx-conf` and click the `Install` button.
1. Reload VSCode.

## Changelog

### 0.3.0 (2021-11-20)

:mega: There are a lot of updates in this version:

1. The syntax of the Nginx configuration file is updated completely
	- Because the syntax from sublime extension and shanoor's repo are long time no updates. So I write a syntax generator for better highlight
	- New syntax is generated from codes. You can find them in [generate-tmLanguage.ts](https://github.com/ahmadalli/vscode-nginx-conf/blob/HEAD/src/syntax/generate-tmLanguage.ts)
	- New syntax supports embedded Lua block
	- New syntax supports the directive statement in multiple lines
	- And extension configuration `nginx-conf-hint.syntax` is removed
2. Optimize hint data loader and document loader. They use less memory now and load data on demand
3. This extension can run as a web extension. So you can use this extension on <https://vscode.dev/> now
4. The coverage of auto-completion is more, and auto-completion is smarter
	1. Auto completion is based on the context and grammar of the configuration now
	2. Fix some wrong auto-completion items
	3. Autocomplete named location
	4. Autocomplete directive's named argument
	5. Autocomplete media types 
5. Add editor definition support for `location` directive
6. Add new extension configuration `nginx-conf-hint.externalModules` for controlling enabled of external modules hint data
7. The source code is rewritten by using Typescript
